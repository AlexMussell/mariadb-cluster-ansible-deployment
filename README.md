# MariaDB Cluster Deployment with Ansible (inc. Vagrant Test Environment)
A MariaDB cluster deployment, and a Vagrant (KVM) test deployment. Currently only for Debian, but will be for other OS's in the near future. If you require help installing KVM and Vagrant, I have done a guide [here](https://alexandermussell.com/kvm/vagrant/ubuntu18.04/virtualisation/2020/03/17/kvm-vagrant-environment.html).
