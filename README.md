# MySQL, Ansible, and Vagrant Deployment
This repo is an Ansible deployment that includes a single node instance or a MariaDB cluster, and a Vagrant (KVM) test environment. If you require help installing KVM and Vagrant, I have done a guide [here](https://alexandermussell.com/kvm/vagrant/ubuntu18.04/virtualisation/2020/03/17/kvm-vagrant-environment.html).
