# MariaDB Cluster Deployment with Ansible (inc. Vagrant Test Environment)
A MariaDB 10.4 cluster deployment, and a Vagrant (KVM) test deployment. Currently only for Debian, but will be for other OS's in the near future. If you require help installing KVM and Vagrant, I have done a guide [here](https://alexandermussell.com/kvm/vagrant/ubuntu18.04/virtualisation/2020/03/17/kvm-vagrant-environment.html).

## WIP
__TODO__: Deploy for Redhat, Fedora, Docker, Convert all options to vars, Create a small app that uses the service (deployed by vagrant), perform backups to a backup node, create an arbitrator.

__COMPLETE__: Basic Debian deployment (tested on Debian 9 (Stretch))

Please create PRs if you fancy collaborating. This is free to use by anybody.
